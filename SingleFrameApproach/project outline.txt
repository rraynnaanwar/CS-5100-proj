1. Take a frame extract position data(x,y), distance to goal, shooting angle
2. Evaluate xG based on these factors
3. Create feature vector along with some manually inputted features(pressure, kind of pass, body part)
4. Pass into neural network to classify as goal/no goal
5. Compare label to calculate xG

xG Model
1. Collect historical shot data across (Bundesliga, La Liga Premier League)
2. Clean data to only include (x,y), distance to goal, shooting angle, + other features
3. Build xG model based off this historical data

Neural network
1. Build neural network for classification (goal/no goal)
input: feature vector containing key features of a shot
